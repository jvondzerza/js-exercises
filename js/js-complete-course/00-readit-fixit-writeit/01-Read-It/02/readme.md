* Open index.html in your browser. What is the difference between this and the previous example?
* Do you notice a difference between the 2 document.write lines?
* Look at the 'Template literals' documentation

There are two lines of text on this page, with the document.write methods being called in the javascript file as opposed to directly in the html file. A variable "amount" has been defined and is used to determine the numbers printed to the screen.
The first document.write line uses quotation marks to distinguish between string content and integer content, and the second line uses an untagged template literal via backticks to create string which includes the value of the integer variable.
