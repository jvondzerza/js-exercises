The variable "movies" is an array containing the names of movies.
The document.write method has been set to write each string in the array in the form of an ordered list via a function that starts at the beginning of the index and increments the value of "i" for as long as the value of "i" is less than the length of the array. The result is a list ordered from 1 to 10 of the movie names contained within the array.
